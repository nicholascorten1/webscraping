Let's build a bot 

Start with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` Then `python3 bot.py` will do the trick. 

I think it'd be nice to set the following goals and keep track of progress somehow. It's a lot. But we see where we get. Here's a plan: 


| Goal                                                | Nicholas | Ho |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|----|
| python                                              |          |    |
| Write a bot                                         |          |    |
| Write documentation                                 |          |    |
| Develop some "user flows" pertaining to segments    |          |    |
| Manage a non-simple codebase                        |          |    |
| Struggle with git (ideally we'd get many conflicts) |          |    |
| Get comfortable with IDE                            |          |    |
| Run a debugger                                      |          |    |
| Refactoring                                         |          |    |
| Write some unit tests                               |          |    |


Maybe we can use a numeric system (1-5) to indicate how well something is going 

Here you can find the link [to the kanban board](https://github.com/nicholascorten1/webscraping/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen). Let the names of the branches correspond to the tags in the issues (e.g., B1 for bot 1)

So a general workflow is:
1. Pick a ticket from the kanban board
2. create a branch in git
3. think and write down a plan for what you are doing in (git)
4. execute (keep committing)
5. create a PR 
6. merge to main 
7. pick up next issue

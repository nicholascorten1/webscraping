Let's build a bot 

Start with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` Then `python3 bot.py` will do the trick. 

I think it'd be nice to set the following goals and keep track of progress somehow. It's a lot. But we see where we get. Here's a plan: 


| Goal                                                | Nicholas | Ho |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|----|
| python                                              |          |    |
| Write a bot                                         |          |    |
| Write documentation                                 |          |    |
| Develop some "user flows" pertaining to segments    |          |    |
| Manage a non-simple codebase                        |          |    |
| Struggle with git (ideally we'd get many conflicts) |          |    |
| Get comfortable with IDE                            |          |    |
| Run a debugger                                      |          |    |
| Write some unit tests                               |          |    |
